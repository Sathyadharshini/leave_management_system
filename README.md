Leave Management System

This is a simple Leave Management System built using Django. It allows employees to submit leave requests, which can then be approved or rejected by managers. The system supports role-based views, so employees and managers see different interfaces. It includes functionality to send email notifications to users whenever the status of a leave request changes. Emails are sent using either Gmail SMTP or Mailtrap for testing purposes. The application is currently running locally and is not deployed online. It also features a clean, responsive front end using custom CSS. The project is structured with separate apps for handling leave requests and email functions, and it includes forms, models, views, and templates required for a smooth user experience. This system is ideal for learning Django and understanding how to integrate email features into a real-world project.
